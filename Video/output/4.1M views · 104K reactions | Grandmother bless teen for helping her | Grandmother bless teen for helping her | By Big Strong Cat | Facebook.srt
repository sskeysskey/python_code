00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hi, could you by any chance help me up
the escalator ?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, that's okay.

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:09,980
My back went out and I'm very scared of
it.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,710
Okay, thank you young man. That's very
nice of you.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,860
You're welcome.

7
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,000
What is your name ?

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,220
My name is Giovanni.

9
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:20,420
Hi Giovanni.

10
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,600
What's your name ?

11
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,620
Three, two, one.

12
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,800
My name is Lucy.

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,380
Nice to meet you, Miss Lucy.

14
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,020
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,170
You're very nice to do this. Now, did you
come to the mall to buy something ?

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,180
Yes.

17
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:35,380
What are you trying to get today ?

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,410
Probably some shoes. I've been needing
some new shoes.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
Oh, new shoes. How old are you ?

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,480
I'm thirteen.

21
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:45,220
Thirteen. Oh, you're a very nice young
man.

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,180
Oh, no, no, no.

23
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,640
It's okay.

24
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,780
Oh, thank you. Thank you young man.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,760
You're welcome.

26
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,620
That is very nice of you.

27
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,700
Oh, you know what ?

28
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:00,740
I have to tell you nobody else helped me.
No one else did.

29
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,720
That's a shame.

30
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:07,660
That is very nice of you. You're the one
person that really helped me.

31
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,280
I'd like to give you something, okay ?

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,240
Okay.

33
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,060
This is a thousand dollars.

34
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,060
A thousand dollars ?

35
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,100
Yes. I want you to take that.

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
A thousand dollars ?

37
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,340
Yes. You go buy your shoes.

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
A thousand dollars ?

39
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,960
Give me a hug.

40
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,820
What ?

41
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,200
A thousand dollars.

42
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,580
Thank you so much.

43
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,840
You're welcome.

44
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,900
I've never seen this much money in my
entire lifetime.

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,160
Well, I hope it helps you, okay ?

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,720
And I hope you have a good day. Why did
you help me ?

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,320
I just felt like it was a good deed. I
saw you came up to me, so obviously you

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,790
really must need help. So I helped you.

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,980
Yes.

50
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:56,260
I got a good income. This is crazy. I
mean, this is insane.

51
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,800
But that's what you get for good deeds,
young man.

52
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,070
My heart is beating so fast right now. I
don't even know what to think right now.

53
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,160
All right. Well, I'll give you another
hug.
