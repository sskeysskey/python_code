Hi, could you by any chance help me up
the escalator?

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.920
Yeah, that's okay.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.980
My back went out and I'm very scared of
it.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.720
Okay.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.680
Okay, thank you young man. That's very
nice of you.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.560
You're welcome.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.660
What is your name?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.920
My name is Giovanni.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.120
Hi Giovanni.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.260

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.580
My name is Lucy.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.140
Nice to meet you, Miss Lucy.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.620
Nice to meet you. You're very nice to do
this. Now, did you come to the mall to buy

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.120
something?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.860
Yes.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.380
What are you trying to get today?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.360
Probably some shoes. I've been needing
some new shoes.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.500
Oh, new shoes. How old are you?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.160
I'm 13.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.220
13? Oh, you're a very nice young man.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.780
Oh, no, no, no.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.340
It's okay.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.860
Oh, thank you. Thank you young man. That
is very nice of you.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580
You're welcome.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.120
Oh, , we'll see you later.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.740
You know, I have to tell you nobody else
helped me. No one else did.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.420
That's a shame.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.080
That's very nice of you and you're the
one person that really helped me and I'd

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.220
like to give you something, okay?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.920
Okay.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.740
This is a thousand dollars.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.720
A thousand dollars?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.520
Yes. And I want you to take that and you
go...

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.020
A thousand dollars?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.360
Yes. And you go buy your shoes.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.120
A thousand dollars?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.740
Yes. Give me a...

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.240
What?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.640
A thousand dollars, young man.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.360
Thank you so much.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.540
You're welcome.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.085
I've never seen this much money in my
entire, like, lifetime.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100
Well, I, I hope it helps you, okay?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.140
And, , I hope you have a good day, and,
you're, you're, a very, why did you help

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.640
me? Why?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.200
Why?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.620
I just felt like it was like a good deed.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.300
I just like, I saw you came up to me, so
obviously you really must need help.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.900
So I helped you.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.700
Yes.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.720
I got a good income.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.700
That was, this is crazy.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.380
I mean, this is insane.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.961
But that's what you get for good deeds,
young man.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.200
My heart is beating so fast right now.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.240
I don't even know what to think right
now.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.360
All right.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.180
Well, I'll give you another one.
