00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Hi, could you by any chance help me up
the escalator ?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
Yeah, that's okay.

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.980
My back went out and I'm very scared of
it.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.710
Okay, thank you young man. That's very
nice of you.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.860
You're welcome.

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.000
What is your name ?

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.220
My name is Giovanni.

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:20.420
Hi Giovanni.

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.600
What's your name ?

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:22.620
Three, two, one.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.800
My name is Lucy.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.380
Nice to meet you, Miss Lucy.

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:28.020
Nice to meet you.

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.170
You're very nice to do this. Now, did you
come to the mall to buy something ?

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.180
Yes.

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.380
What are you trying to get today ?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.410
Probably some shoes. I've been needing
some new shoes.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.560
Oh, new shoes. How old are you ?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.480
I'm thirteen.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.220
Thirteen. Oh, you're a very nice young
man.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
Oh, no, no, no.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.640
It's okay.

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.780
Oh, thank you. Thank you young man.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.760
You're welcome.

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:54.620
That is very nice of you.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.700
Oh, you know what ?

00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.740
I have to tell you nobody else helped me.
No one else did.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720
That's a shame.

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:07.660
That is very nice of you. You're the one
person that really helped me.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.280
I'd like to give you something, okay ?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.240
Okay.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.060
This is a thousand dollars.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.060
A thousand dollars ?

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.100
Yes. I want you to take that.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
A thousand dollars ?

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.340
Yes. You go buy your shoes.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.440
A thousand dollars ?

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.960
Give me a hug.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.820
What ?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:28.200
A thousand dollars.

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.580
Thank you so much.

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:30.840
You're welcome.

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:31.900
I've never seen this much money in my
entire lifetime.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.160
Well, I hope it helps you, okay ?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.720
And I hope you have a good day. Why did
you help me ?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.320
I just felt like it was a good deed. I
saw you came up to me, so obviously you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.790
really must need help. So I helped you.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.980
Yes.

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.260
I got a good income. This is crazy. I
mean, this is insane.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.800
But that's what you get for good deeds,
young man.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.070
My heart is beating so fast right now. I
don't even know what to think right now.

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.160
All right. Well, I'll give you another
hug.
